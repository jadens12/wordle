# wordle

This project is a recreating of the famous game Wordle! 
- Guess the word in six tries.
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.
- After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

If you want to play again after the round, just enter y/n and the program will generate another word for you to guess
I am currently working on creating Dordle which is two Wordle games combined!
